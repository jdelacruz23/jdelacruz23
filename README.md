## More things about me.

I **love** miatas specifically the NA version of it.
*Here's a picture of it for reference*

*Brief history about the miata*

The generations are what follows:
1. NA (best looking one)
2. NB (eh)
3. NC (underrated)
4. ND (basically, modern NA)

*Why a miata?*
Do you like? If these boxes are all ticked for you then get one.

- [x] Low-powered car = rolling thru all the gears
- [x] Easier to clean car
- [x] A decent looking convertible for the price
- [x] Miata is the answer
